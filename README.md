#Contribution Guidelines#


----------


Contributing to open source projects is a rewarding experience for both the
academic and professional developer. Though when looking for a place to begin in
open source contribution one can face many roadblocks. These roadblocks create
open source communities in which the few have a voice. In an effort to give
everyone an opportunity to contribute to open source projects, we have listed
some ideas for contributing.   

##Things you should contribute to:##

 - Writing/improving documentation/guides Adding tests   
   Making setup easier 
 - Making a simple example app
   demonstrating the project’s
   usage  
 - Fixing a bug 
 - Adding a Feature
 - Design for a homepage
 - Making lists of useful
   tools/resources
 - Helping other people do all of these 
   things

##Keep in mind that:##
 - Before contributing you should check if there is a CONTRIBUTING.md or other
   contributor guidelines. 
 - You don't need to fully understand a project in order to contribute to it
 - Errors happen for everyone, including experienced people. The trick is
   learning how to read the errors and knowing what to search for. 
 - Remember that maintainers are often busy people
  - Do not be offended if a maintainer doesn't respond quickly, just send them a
    “bump” if you don’t hear back in a week or so.
 - When submitting pull requests consider adding a note of: “this is my first
   open source contribution”, maintainers are always excited to see this.
 - Add `/cc @mentorusername` in any issues or pull requests if you would like
   additional feedback
